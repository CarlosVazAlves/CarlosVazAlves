👋 Hi, I’m Carlos Alves!
👀 I’m interested in working with Android, using Kotlin. Personally, I would like to learn and develop some homebrew stuff in C++

🌱 I’m currently learning several languages. I'm about to finish my degree in Computer Science, and I've learned to work with quite a few languages.<br/>
To this list, I can add:
- 🌱🌱 Assembly
- 🌱🌱 C
- 🌱🌱 Java
- 🌱🌱 Kotlin
- 🌱🌱 C#
- 🌱🌱 JavaScript (HTML and CSS (it's implied =P))
- 🌱🌱 Python (on my own)
- 🌱🌱 ProLog (about to start)

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with someone who offers a proper challenge! I get easily bored with menial tasks.

📫 You can reach me in amdcarlos@hotmail.com

I'm currently developing a Xml Parser library. All other libraries available to parse XML seems to complicated to use.<br/>
So I decided to create a new one, as easy to use as possible.<br/>
I've developed it in Kotlin, but if some .Net fans find in useful, I can create a C# version of it.<br/>
If there is some bug you detected in my library, or if you would like to suggest a new functionality, feel free to contact me.<br/>
